### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Gilles!

I'm currently working at Microsoft on HoloLens and Mixed Reality experiences. I maintain a Dockerized version of [Exit Game Photon Server](https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/Server) which you can see [here](https://github.com/GillesZunino/Dockerized-Photon). Monitor Photon Server with [Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) with my [Photon Counter Publisher](https://github.com/GillesZunino/Photon-Azure-CounterPublishers). Easily get Azure AD access tokens for [Insomnia REST client](https://insomnia.rest/) with [Insomnia Plugin for Azure AD Authentication](https://github.com/GillesZunino/insomnia-plugin-azure-ad-authentication).
